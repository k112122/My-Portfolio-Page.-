<h1> About Me </h1>

<p> Hi! My name is Kanika Andhare. I am 13 years old and I study at Oberoi International School.
     I live in Mumbai, India with my parents and my older sister. 
     I am passionate about a lot of things including writing, singing, dancing and coding. 
     I joined White Hat Jr 10 months back and it has been a very interesting journey. 
     I have learned how to code simple games in Java-Script and am currently learning how to code in HTML. 
     On this page, you will find some of my projects and games that I have created. </p>
